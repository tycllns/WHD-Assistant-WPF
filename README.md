WEBHELPDESK ASSITANT : This is a container for our web helpdesk program at one of my jobs. This program has been stripped down and doesn't work because it needs to be connected to the company's domain for the original code to work.  

This program does not work so I have archived it. This is for documentation purposes only.

Features:

Templates: Users could make templates that would persist in an xml file in the user's %appdata% folder. Templates had entries for assigned tech, location, request type and ticket status. This was crucial to our job because the Solarwinds webhelpdesk did not have such templating. This saved us a ton of time.
Shortcuts: We did not have a formal IT landing page with shortcuts to our most used websites and web apps so this program sort of took its place and had shortcuts to these.
Themes: This was just something I did for fun, the user could change their theme's font color background color and secondary colors to anything with an html code and save that so it would persist in their %appdata% folder
Stats and Achievements: Another thing I added for fun/motivation. The app would track how many ticket closures and ticket profilings the user would do and once a certain threshold was reached the user was given an acheivement which would pop up on the screen for them.
Billing Query: Before I built this app we were going into razorsql and putting in a long query when we needed to check billing codes, dates, times or anything else when making corrections to billing data for staff. This billing section made it super easy to search for these and would display a datagrid with all the information you needed based on a patient id, dates and times and an operand.
